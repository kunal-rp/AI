This is based off of a project I did in my AI class


In that, we used the misplaced tile heuristic and the ManhattanDistance heuristic to use a* to find the solution to a 8 PuzzleBoard
There, the puzzle had one blank space that could only move around.

In this project, I modified it so that the '0' is an actual tile, and allowed any tile to be able to swap with its neighbors above, below, to its left/right.
